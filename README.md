# Neural Networks and Data Analysis Projects

[![es](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-es-red.svg)](/README-ES.md)

These projects are part of the _Técnicas de Aprendizaje Automático_ (Advanced Learning Techniques) subject in the Computer Science Degree at University of Valladolid.
The main objective of this main project is to learn the basics about deep learning techniques which will lead to understand some concepts in order to scale up to major levels.

There are eleven projects which includes Data Set Analysis with Weka and some Neural Network building using raw python with sklearn modules.

## Index
Here is an index in order to see the contents of the projects.
